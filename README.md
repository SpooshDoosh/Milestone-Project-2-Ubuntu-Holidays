      * Navigation bar is available on every page and has links to all pages.
      * Home page has buttons linking to Cape Town page and Durban page.
      * Cape Town page has a button on each package that will take user to the contact form.
      * Durban page has a button on each package that will take user to the contact form.
      * The Send button on the contact form will submit the form and confirm to the user that the form has been submitted succesfully.
